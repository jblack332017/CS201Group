<h2>Why would he do this?</h2>
<p id ="blurb">Because he can! Ncage is one of the most prolific actors of our time. His acting abilities and his superior looks make him a Hollywood heart throb. He has stared in amazing films such as "National Treasure 2", "Ghost Rider" and "Next". He is the penultimate method actor, a true gem.</p> <img src = "http://cdn.financebuzz.io/images/2016/02/03/nicolascagepainting18.jpg" id = "nicpic2">
